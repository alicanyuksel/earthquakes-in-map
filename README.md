# The earthquakes in Turkey: Data visualization on interactive map

For this project, I used **Python** on the backend (**Flask RESTful API**) and **JavaScript** on the front. The goal is to visualize the earthquakes in Turkey on map with [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com). The project is deployed on [depremneredeoldu.com](https://depremneredeoldu.com)
